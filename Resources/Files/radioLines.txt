ðŸŽµIt started generations ago when the miners of Haven Springs didn't have a beer to end their workday with. Two men created a brew for their coworkers and like what they did back then we still do today. It begins with the snowcapped Colorado Rocky Mountains and the rivers that flow, giving us clear crisp waters. We still use the best state barley that has been handed down from generation to generation to produce an uncompromising beer that can only be found here. To the two miners that created, and the generations of workers that kept producing it, we thank you and raise a glass of Old Mill Amber Ale to you. Old Mill Amber Ale, the taste of Haven Springs Colorado.ðŸŽµ
Just a reminder to everyone. There was a report last night of a black beer getting into someone's garbage. Please only put your cans out on the day of pick up and not overnight. Mr. Blackbear had a feed last night and the state wildlife had to be called in to tranquilize it.
